# Patrick Ruf Portfolio

## Description

This application is my portfolio I will be using to apply for future jobs. Past projects are displayed, and new ones will be added in the future. The page was built using react and bootstrap CSS, and deployed via Netlify.
It has a navbar with buttons that redirect the user to my portfolio, about, and contact pages. It has a footer with links to my Instagram, LinkedIn, and Github.
The portfolio page contains projects I have made or contributed to, and the images are links that take you to the deployed projects.
The about page has my picture and a short bio.
The contact page allows a user to submit their email and name.

While making this application I've learned a ton about react, bootstrap, and deploying to netlify.
